      <uploaded_files>

      </uploaded_files>
      I've uploaded a code repository in the directory {{working_dir}}. Consider the following PR description:

      <pr_description>
      {{problem_statement}}
      </pr_description>

      Can you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?
      I've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!
      Your task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the {{working_dir}} directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.
      Follow these steps to resolve the issue:
      1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repository structure and find code relevant to the <pr_description>
      2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it using the bash tool, to confirm the error
      3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue
      4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!
      5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well
      Your thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.

          **STOP! BEFORE SUBMITTING:** You MUST provide the CODE CONTEXT you used to generate this patch.

          **REQUIRED FORMAT:**
          In your NEXT response, you MUST:
          1. Output a <PATCH_CONTEXT> block listing ALL source files and line ranges you examined
          2. Then call `submit` again

          **Format for <PATCH_CONTEXT>:**
          <PATCH_CONTEXT>
          File: /testbed/path/to/file1.ext
          Lines: 10-50

          File: /testbed/path/to/file2.ext
          Lines: 100-150
          </PATCH_CONTEXT>

          **Rules:**
          - List ONLY source files you viewed/edited (not test files)
          - Include the EXACT line ranges you examined
          - Do NOT include code snippets, explanations, or commentary
          - Do NOT skip this step - the <PATCH_CONTEXT> block is MANDATORY

          **YOUR NEXT RESPONSE MUST CONTAIN:**
          1. The <PATCH_CONTEXT> block (not inside a code fence)
          2. A call to `submit`

          Thank you for your work on this issue. Please carefully follow the steps below to help review your changes.

          1. If you made any changes to your code after running the reproduction script, please run the reproduction script again.
            If the reproduction script is failing, please revisit your changes and make sure they are correct.
            If you have already removed your reproduction script, please ignore this step.
          2. Remove your reproduction script (if you haven't done so already).
          3. If you have modified any TEST files, please revert them to the state they had before you started fixing the issue.
            You can do this with `git checkout -- /path/to/test/file`. Use below <diff> to find the files you need to revert.
          4. Run the submit command again to confirm.
